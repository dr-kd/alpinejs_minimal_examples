# Alpinejs minimal examples.

These modern javascript frameworks often make me feel stupid.  One of the reasons for this is that the examples I find online are full of extraneous things like adding tailwind.css or doing multiple things at once.  What I need is a series of examples that each do one thing only - with some indication of how to glue them together.

So here's a repo to store these examples.  The rules are:

* No dependencies except alpine js.
* Bare minimum example means just that.
* Currently the examples are just snippets to paste into somewhere like [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/).
* The examples should be named for what they do.
